Yet another fetching tool written in POSIX shell.

Why i made this? Cause [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) is slow *(Yes, i put neofetch on my shellrc.)*

Execution time is really important for me, thats why i made this simple fetching tool.

## Installation
```sh
sudo curl -fsSl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dyzean/coffee-fetch/main/cfetch -o /usr/bin/cfetch
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/cfetch
cfetch
```
